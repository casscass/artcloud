## Problem Definition and Solution
---
### The Problem
There is a need for an online store dedicated to buying and selling of artworks made by local Sydney artists.

This statement is justified by answering the following questions:

  - Why is a need for an online store dedicated to buying and selling of artworks in Sydney?
  - Why online and not through Art Galleries 
  - Why Locally to Sydney?
  - What's wrong with the sites that already exist?
  - How is this site different to existing online sites that sell artwork?


#### Why online and not through Art Galleries 
Art Galleries charge 35% to 50% commission for sales, as a result artists only receive  between 50-65% of the sale price of their work. Selling through an online site that only changes 5% -10% allows artists to receive between 90-95% of the sales.

 Having an online option provides greater ease and convenience for buying. It opens up the range and geolocation of potential buyers to, potentially the global village but, focusing on the Sydney market, it allows buyers to purchase at any time (e.g. outside business hours) and because the artists will be predominantly located in the Sydney area, it ensures speedy delivery of artwork. Also allows for people that cannot physically access a store.

#### Why Locally to Sydney?
Only a few of the many Sydney artists are represented by Galleries. As a result they have to finance their own solo of group exhibitions.

Sydney has many local artists who do excellent artwork, however the high price of hireing a gallery (in Sydney) for an exhibition and giving the gallery a large percentage of the sales act to restrict artists from exhibiting their work frequently. 

This App would allow artists to have their work visable and available for purchase 24/7 without high overheads.


Other sites for online selling of artwork exist, however they are:


#### What's wrong with the sites that already exist?
Other sites for online selling of artwork exist, however they:
 - Don't just sell artwork. e.g. www.artmegallery.com.au also sells craft, jewellery , lamps decor, hand painted cursors, marbles etc.
  - Redirect the buyer to the gallery that represents the artist. So you are in effect buying from the Gallery not the artist.
  - Promote the Gallery not the artist
  - Have a funky website but its not operational. See https://www.artcloud.xyz/

#### How is this site different to existing online sites that sell artwork?
 - Artists sell direct to the buyer, without gallery overheads.
 - Only artwork is sold on this site
 - No Joining fees
 
### The Solution
To build the Art Cloud site that include the following:
 - Artists sell direct to the buyer, without gallery overheads.
 - Only artwork is sold on this site so thier are no other products to distract the buyer from the artworks.
 - No Joining fees and no commisssions charged.

##  Workflow

The original workflow for art cloud was conceptualised in the diagram below. There were some minor alterations made during the development process, specifically the Show Artwork Index page became the landing page. 

The workflow was created with Draw at https://www.draw.io/#G1d34gjmpjcdiu_W--hS_DVSwbyQRy7mlW

## Wireframes

Content-first mockups were created using Figma and can be viewed [here]https://www.figma.com/file/0MrAunIkkbD3zDjE3fKtGUlV/ArtCloud-Wireframes.

## ERD
The ERD was created at https://www.dbdesigner.net/designer/schema/168142
The original conception was as follows:

## Style Guide

This app uses a very minamal colour scheme to showcase the artwork images and ensure that the users focus is not pulled or distracted from the artwork images by any bright colours. Following the minamal 'look' Roboto was chosen as the font because it is a clear font with clean simlpe lines that is highly legable in browsers. It is also clear at a small size so it is easy to read on moble divices.
Colours and fonts were chosen as below.

##  Tools & Methodologies
Project management skills are demonstrated through use of Trello and Github 

### Trello
Project planning and estimation was handled through Trello. 
Trello cards were used to track donuts and sprinkles and to keeptrack of progress
Below there are screenshots of Trello showing the progression towards the 'DONE' card. 

See Art Cloud's [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cknJByWB/art-cloud-online-art-shop) for the final details.

A snapshot of my Trello board near the start of the project is below.

##  Requirements - Rails Application Code
Ruby on Rails development skills were demonstrated by implementing the following requirements,
1. App created using using Ruby on Rails
2. postgresql database was used in development
3. Figaro was used to  protect API keys etc. 
4. Stripe was implemented as a payment system
5. Sendgrid was used to send transactional emails 
6. The app has a search function. That searches by artists, catagory, medium and price.
7. Carrierwave was used to upload images
8. Devise was used for  authorisation (users have restrictions on what they can see and edit)

## How to setup, configure and use application
To use this application got to github
![github](https://github.com/casscass/artcloud) 

Clone the app and in your terminal
git clone 'PASTE HERE'
CD into the app 
Start the rails server 'rails s'
Open a new tab in your browser and type localhost:3000/ it should look like this: http://localhost:3000/
The landing page of art cloud will open.

## Result
Doing this project clarified my understanding of how ruby on rails works.
